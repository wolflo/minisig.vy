# Minisig.vy

A vyper implementation of the [Minisig](https://github.com/wolflo/minisig).

This contract is used for a "second opinion" from a different compiler on the generated bytecode.
However, it differs in functionality partially because of the (intentional) limitations of the vyper compiler.
The vyper contract is not currently up-to-date with the huff version of the Minisig, and it is not a reliable reference for the contract interface or expected semantics.
